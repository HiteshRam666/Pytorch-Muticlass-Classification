# 🌌 PyTorch Multi-Class Classification

Welcome to this PyTorch classification project! Here, we dive into the world of multi-class classification using a neural network model built with PyTorch. We’ll be working with the `make_blobs` and `make_moons` datasets from Scikit-Learn to visualize and understand decision boundaries, improve model performance, and create an engaging classification experience.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **README.md**: You’re reading it! Provides an overview of the project.

## 🚀 Project Overview

This project covers the essentials of multi-class classification in PyTorch, including:

1. **Data Generation**:
    - Using `make_blobs` for synthetic multi-class data with Gaussian blobs.
    - Experimenting with the `make_moons` dataset to observe and improve complex decision boundaries.

2. **Model Architecture**:
    - Input layer, hidden layers with ReLU activations, and an output layer with softmax for multi-class predictions.
    - Custom PyTorch model class (`blob_model`) to handle data with a flexible, modular design.

3. **Training & Evaluation**:
    - Setting up an efficient training loop to optimize the model.
    - Improving decision boundary plots for clear visual understanding of model predictions.

## ⚙️ How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**:
    - Generate datasets using Scikit-Learn’s `make_blobs` and `make_moons`.
    - Preprocess data for compatibility with PyTorch and split into training and testing sets.

2. **Model Training**:
    - Define the neural network architecture with PyTorch's `torch.nn` module.
    - Train the model on the dataset and evaluate its performance.

3. **Decision Boundary Visualization**:
    - Visualize model predictions and decision boundaries to see how well the classifier separates classes.
    - Experiment with different architectures and hyperparameters to enhance the model's boundary definition.

## 🎯 Goals of the Project

- **Build a flexible and reusable multi-class classification model** using PyTorch.
- **Improve decision boundary plots** to better illustrate the classifier's capabilities.
- **Experiment with model parameters** to understand how architecture impacts performance on complex datasets.

## 📊 Results

The project showcases how a PyTorch-based neural network can classify synthetic data points in multi-class settings. Here’s a summary of the results:

- Achieved high accuracy on the `make_blobs` dataset with distinct decision boundaries.
- Enhanced decision boundaries on the `make_moons` dataset through model fine-tuning and visualization improvements.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Neural Network Flexibility**: PyTorch provides an intuitive way to experiment with neural network architectures, making it an excellent choice for custom implementations.
- **Visualization**: Decision boundary visualizations offer insights into model strengths and weaknesses, helping to guide model improvement.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Simple changes, like modifying the number of hidden layers or activations, can significantly affect performance.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
